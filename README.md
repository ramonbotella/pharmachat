# PharmaChat

PharmaChat is a Python-based application that allows users to query a local language model (LLM) about specific medicaments using their leaflets as context. The application scrapes the leaflet information from the CIMA API and uses the Ollama local LLM to provide answers to user questions.

## Features

- Scrape medicament leaflets from the CIMA API.
- Query a local LLM (Ollama) with questions about medicaments.
- Command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ramonbotella/pharmachat.git
    cd pharmachat
    ```

2. **Install pharmachat and dependencies using setup_repo.sh script:**

    ```sh
    ./setup_repo.sh
    ```

    This script will install the project dependencies using Poetry and set up the pre-commit hooks."



## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

You can use the CLI to ask questions about specific medicaments.

```sh
pharmachat pharma_assistant <medicament_name> <question>
```
